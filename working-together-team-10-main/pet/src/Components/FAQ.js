    <h3 style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>What are your toys made out of?</h3>
    <p style={{marginTop:"5px"}}> Our Squeaky Chew Ball, Squeaky Chew Stick, Dual Layer Bone and Dual Layer Ring are  made from extra-durable rubber. Our Dri-Tech Rope Knot are made from moisture-wicking shaped fibers. All toys are tested thoroughly to be dog-safe.</p>
    <h3 style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>What toys are recommended for Tyson type dogs, the real tough time chewers?</h3>
    <p style={{marginTop:"5px"}}>No toy is totally indestructible, but toys marked Extra Durable can withstand a more aggressive chewer, even the heavyweights..</p>
    <h3 style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>How do I know which products to buy for my dog?</h3>
    <p style={{marginTop:"5px"}}>We recommend toy sizes by your pup’s weight. Please take our Pawsonality quiz to see the recommendations for the toys and food products</p>
    <h3 style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>Are your toys safe for a range of ages from puppies to millennials to senior dogs?</h3>
    <p style={{marginTop:"5px"}}>Yes! All of our toys are safe and recommend for any aged dog, from the eeniest pups to older dogs that have been around the block once or twice.</p>
    <h3 style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>What are your  chew toys made of?</h3>

    <h3 style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>More of a statement than of a question, but my dog doesn’t like his/her unleashing pawsonality toy.</h3>
    <p style={{marginTop:"5px"}}>Well this section isn’t for statements, only questions. Just kidding, a few points here. First of all, clearly all dogs don’t like all toys and food products. And some dogs (the incredibly un-fun ones) don’t like any of them. But if your dog likes a certain type of toy there is a high likelihood. If you still have an issue, please reach out to our team by sending a note: pawsonality@gmail.com</p>
